    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Jailhouse Strong workout plan is inspired by the principles of prison fitness, designed to build muscle, resilience, and functional strength with limited resources.</p>
    <p>The program emphasizes the importance of consistent, functional workouts that can be done anywhere. Techniques include bodyweight exercises and creative strength training methods to simulate the environment faced by those incarcerated.</p>

  <!-- Why Prisoners Get Strong -->
  <section id="why-get-strong" class="container my-1">
    <h2>Why Prisoners Get Strong, Lean, and Ripped</h2>
    <p>Prisoners develop powerful physiques due to the need for survival in a tough environment. This training prioritizes functional strength and resilience, allowing prisoners to build strong bodies without extensive equipment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Survival of the Fittest</strong>: Strength in prison is critical for survival, creating a need for an "alpha" physique that exudes strength.</li>
      <li><strong>Testosterone and Environment</strong>: A hostile prison environment and higher testosterone levels in prisoners contribute to more muscle growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Routine Consistency</strong>: Structured prison routines ensure consistent training, making workout sessions highly prioritized.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Bodyweight Strength Training Section -->
  <section id="bodyweight-training" class="container my-1">
    <h2>Bodyweight Strength Training</h2>
    <p>This section details various bodyweight exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, and burpees that can be done with no equipment, making it ideal for anyone with limited access to a gym.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Push-Ups</strong>: Multiple variations for building chest, shoulders, and core strength, including Diamond, Knuckle, and Explosive Push-Ups.</li>
      <li><strong>Pull-Ups</strong>: These develop the back and biceps; variations like Wide Grip, Chin-Ups, and Commando Pull-Ups target different muscle groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Leg Exercises</strong>: Hindu Squats, Lunges, and the Tyson Squat Workout are ideal for developing lower body strength without weights.</li>
      <li><strong>Core Exercises</strong>: Movements like Hanging Leg Raises, Planks, and Bicycles strengthen the core for stability and protection.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Nutrition Section -->
  <section id="nutrition" class="container my-1">
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is essential for muscle growth and recovery. This plan focuses on high-protein meals and consistent eating times, as well as supplement options where available.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protein Intake</strong>: Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. Access to quality protein sources helps build muscle, even though prisoners may rely on simpler options like tuna and protein powder.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent Meal Times</strong>: Eating meals at the same time each day supports the body’s natural rhythms and aids muscle repair.</li>
      <li><strong>Supplement Use</strong>: While prisoners are limited in supplements, accessible options like protein powders can support growth, though they should not replace whole foods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Progression and Overload Section -->
  <section id="progression" class="container my-1">
    <h2>Progression & Overload</h2>
    <p>Progression is essential in this program to ensure continuous muscle growth and strength gains. A consistent increase in intensity and resistance is key to progress.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Principle of Overload</strong>: Gradually increase weight, reps, or decrease rest times to continuously challenge the muscles.</li>
      <li><strong>Progressive Bodyweight Training</strong>: Advanced bodyweight methods such as Tyson Squats, Pyramid Pull-Ups, and Decline Push-Ups allow for a gradual increase in intensity.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency and Dedication</strong>: Regular, intense workouts are vital, mirroring the commitment seen in prison environments where training becomes a valued routine.</li>
    </ul>
